Bugs
----
- BUG: tx_damlighbox_flex displays standard FF if well edited in list module/single field mode

Notes
-----

tt_news correct behaviour with damlightbox is: 
- as long as images are in the standard news field, nothing happens, even if the damlightbox field is filled
- could be: as soon as the damlightbox field is filled, those images take precedence (but then noImage_stdWrap cannot be used)
- as soon as the standard field is empty and the damlightbox field is filled, noImage_stdWrap activates damlightbox handling of images
- what about firstImageIsPreview
- what about imageCount

- include noImg_stdWrap in the imageMarkerfuction
