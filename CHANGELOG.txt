	* NEW: vCalc and hCalc for tx_damlightbox->addAdditionalImg now use stdWrap to retrieve their values
	* NEW: flexform field allows to override the lightbox dimensions for a specific image (notation is imagenumber:width,height;)
	* NEW: title tag for the lightbox page now taken from DAM title of the current image (thx. Dr. Ronald P. Steiner)
	* NEW: Lightbox content may now be cached. Big thanks and credits to Dr. Ronald P. Steiner!
	* BUGFIX: RECORDS object used instead of CONTENT object for rendering the lightbox content. This way the lightbox CE is not bound to the page but might stay anywhere in the pagetree.
	* BUGFIX: Save&Print buttons did not work. Changes still need to be implemented into savefile.php of pmkslimbox
	* CHANGE: height changed to min-height in slimbox.css
